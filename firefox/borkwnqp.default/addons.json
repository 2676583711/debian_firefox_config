LanguageTool finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, like mixing up there/their, a/an, or repeating a word, and it can detect some grammar problems. It supports more than 25 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian.\n\nLanguageTool checks the spelling and grammar of almost any text you type on the web. It is compatible with almost all text, regardless of source, including social networks such as Twitter or LinkedIn and online e-mail services, such as Gmail. Very few sites like docs.google.com, addons.mozilla.org, and chrome.google.com currently aren't supported - please use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/languagetool/kjcoklfhicmkbfifghaecedbohbmofkm for Google Docs instead.\n\nWith LanguageTool our aim is to give users a fully-featured grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it’s also smart enough to recognize mistakes that native speakers commonly make and it will improve your writing overall. This grammar and spelling correction works across all variations of common language; distinguishing between U.S. and British English, for instance. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use but that are not found in a conventional dictionary. LanguageTool will recognize these words in future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike Grammarly (\"Grammerly\" :-) and Ginger, LanguageTool works for many languages and offers many of the same features.\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to https://languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection. No account is needed to use this extension. We don't store your IP address. See our privacy policy for more details.\n\n\nWhy does LanguageTool require permission \"Access your data for all websites\"?\n\nThis permission is required to read the text you type into text fields. LanguageTool will only read the text you type into multi-line fields. Single-line fields and password fields are skipped.\n\n\nBugs\n\nPlease report bugs at https://forum.languagetool.org or at github.\n\n\nPremium Version\n\nWe offer a Premium version which is linked from several places in the add-on. This add-on also works without payment and registration, though.\n\n\nOffline Use (recommended only if you're an advanced computer user)\n\nTo use this add-on with a local server, unzip the LanguageTool desktop version from our homepage and run this command (requires Java):\n\njava -cp languagetool-server.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer --allow-origin '*'\n\nThen, open the add-on configuration and set http://localhost:8081/v2 as the server URL and save the configuration. Note that the default configuration of the local server might lack some features of the server running at languagetool.org - see this comparison for details.\n\n\nOld Versions\n\nOld versions are still available at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/languagetool/versions/.","weeklyDownloads":2159,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"LanguageTooler GmbH","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/user/14508210/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212346.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212346.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212347.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212347.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212348.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212348.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212349.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212349.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212352.png?modified=1544977775","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212352.png?modified=1544977775","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6233,"reviewCount":125,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/zh-CN/firefox/addon/languagetool/reviews/","updateDate":1559751910000},{"id":"jid1-Xo5SuA6qc1DFpw@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/511/511962-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/511/511962-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/511/511962-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Emoji Cheatsheet","version":"2.0.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/684007/emoji_cheatsheet-2.0.1-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":1517974,"homepageURL":"http://johannhof.github.io/emoji-helper","supportURL":"https://github.com/johannhof/emoji-helper/issues","description":"A reference for the codes to generate Emojis on popular sites like GitHub or Basecamp and Unicode characters for Twitter and Facebook.\nSearch Emojis by name or view recently selected items.
